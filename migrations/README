# 🎙️ Late Show API

Welcome to the Late Show API — a RESTful web service built with Flask that manages episodes, guests, and appearances on *The Late Show*. This API is designed to handle guest appearances with ratings, fetch information about episodes and guests, and create new appearance records via a clean, REST-compliant interface.

## 📝 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate a backend for a talk show guest management system using Flask and SQLAlchemy. The API enables operations like:
- Fetching all episodes or specific ones.
- Viewing all guests.
- Adding new appearances.
- Enforcing validation rules.

All endpoints return JSON responses and follow REST conventions.

---

## ✨ Features

- Flask-based REST API
- Models:
  - `Guest`
  - `Episode`
  - `Appearance`
- Relationships:
  - An `Episode` has many `Guest`s through `Appearance`
  - A `Guest` has many `Episode`s through `Appearance`
- Validations (e.g., appearance rating between 1–5)
- Database seeding from a CSV file
- Blueprint routing
- Error handling with appropriate status codes

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Flask SQLAlchemy
- Flask Migrate
- SQLite (development)
- Postman (API testing)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lateshow-firstname-lastname.git
cd lateshow-firstname-lastname
````

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set environment variable

```bash
export FLASK_APP=run.py
```

---

## 🧱 Database Setup

### 1. Initialize the database

```bash
flask db init
```

### 2. Create migration

```bash
flask db migrate -m "initial"
```

### 3. Apply migration

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

---

## 🌱 Seeding the Database

Make sure `guests.csv` is present in the root directory. It should look like:

```csv
name,occupation
Michael J. Fox,actor
Sandra Bernhard,Comedian
Tracey Ullman,television actress
```

Then run:

```bash
python -m app.seed
```

---

## 🧪 Testing with Postman

1. Open Postman.
2. Import `challenge-4-lateshow.postman_collection.json` file.
3. Test all routes using the collection.
